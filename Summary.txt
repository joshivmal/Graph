Directed Graph  and Undirected Graph

Directed Graph

For Cycle detection we use ->  Dfs with two array and Kahn's algorithm 

For Shortest Path ->
                    (if graph has no cycle) then sort in topological order then relaxation of weights 
                    else  ->  (+ve weights) use Dijasktras algorithm (for -ve weight Dijasktras went into infinite loop)

                    Dijasktras
                                -> using priority queue
                                -> using queue
                                -> using set
                                        
                              (-ve weights) Bellman-Ford: Suitable for single-source shortest paths and can detect negative-weight cycles.
                                            Floyd-Warshall: multiple-source shortest paths Suitable for all-pairs shortest paths and can detect negative-weight cycles.
Minimum Spanning Tree : spanning tree which has n nodes and n-1 edges and connects all nodes of graph, minimum spanning tree
                        is the minimum sum spanning tree, they can be multiple MST of a graph
        MST making algorithm:
                        -> Kruskal Algorithm : 
                        -> Prim's Algorithm : find's shortest edges from each node( uses greedy method)


Undirected Graph

For Cycle detection we use -> normal DFS and BFS with parent-child  method and visited array

For Shortest Path -> normal relaxation with BFS (if graph has no cycle)
                  -> Dijasktras 
                                -> using priority queue
                                -> using queue
                                -> using set
